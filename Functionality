Introduction
The code is a Python script that generates an electricity bill based on user input. It reads user data from a CSV file, calculates the energy charge, tax, and total charge, updates the bill template with user data and billing details, and saves the modified bill as an image. Finally, it sends the bill image via WhatsApp using the pywhatkit library.

Code Explanation
Let's break down the code into sections and explain each part:
Imported Libraries
The code begins by importing the required libraries for various functionalities such as reading CSV files, generating PDFs, working with images, and sending WhatsApp messages.
Read the CSV File
The code reads the user data from a CSV file using the pd.read_csv() function and stores it in the Data variable. The CSV file contains information such as the user's name, address, customer number, meter number, previous reading, and current reading.
Input Meter Number
The code prompts the user to enter their meter number and stores it in the Meter_No variable.
Find Corresponding User Data
The code iterates over the rows of the Data DataFrame to find the row that matches the entered meter number. Once found, it stores the row index in the variable i.
Update Current Reading
The code prompts the user to enter the current reading and updates the corresponding cell in the Cur_Reading column of the Data DataFrame.
Calculate Units Consumed
The code calculates the units consumed in the current billing cycle by subtracting the previous reading from the current reading.
Calculate Charges
The code calculates various charges based on the consumed units. It includes fixed charges, fuel charges (twice the units consumed), energy charges (based on the unit slabs), and tax (15% of the total charges).
Update Current Units
The code updates the current units in the Cur_Units column of the Data DataFrame.
Read the Electricity Bill Template
The code reads the electricity bill template from a CSV file using the pd.read_csv() function and stores it in the e variable. The bill template contains placeholders for user data and billing details.
Update Placeholders in the Bill Template
The code updates the placeholders in the bill template with the corresponding user data and calculated billing details using the .loc method of the DataFrame. It fetches the data from the Data DataFrame and updates the corresponding cells in the e DataFrame.
Modify the Bill Image
The code loads the bill template image using the Image.open() function from the PIL library. It then uses the ImageDraw.Draw() function to create a drawing object on the image. It sets the font type and size using the ImageFont.truetype() function. Finally, it uses the draw.text() function to write text on specific coordinates of the image, updating the user data and billing details.
Save the Modified Bill Image
The code saves the modified bill image as a PNG file using the image.save() function.
Send the Bill Image via WhatsApp
The code uses the pywhatkit.sendwhats_image() function from the pywhatkit library to send the bill image via WhatsApp. It takes the recipient's phone number and the file path of the bill image as arguments.
Update Previous Units and Reading
The code updates the previous units and reading in the Prev_Units and Prev_Reading columns of the Data DataFrame. It sets the previous units to the current units and resets the current units and reading to zero.
Future Implementations and Updates
The code for calculating electricity bill can be further improved by adding the following features:
 The ability to calculate the bill for multiple customers at once.
The ability to generate the bill in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, and CSV.
The ability to integrate with other systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
